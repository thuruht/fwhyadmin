# Farewell/Howdy Admin Project Status

## Last Updated: June 16, 2025

## Overall Status

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the Farewell/Howdy admin project, including what works, what doesn't, and what needs improvement.

## What Works Well

### Frontend

- ✅ State switching between Farewell/Howdy now working properly
- ✅ 404 page styling is consistent and loads correctly
- ✅ Blog posts display correctly on the frontend
- ✅ Video carousel structure is supported
- ✅ Main site CSS is properly applied

### Admin Backend

- ✅ Authentication using JWT tokens works correctly
- ✅ Blog post retrieval and display works
- ✅ API routing for frontend access to blog endpoints works without authentication
- ✅ Admin authentication uses proper secrets instead of hardcoded credentials

## What Needs Improvement

### Frontend Issues

- ⚠️ Some fonts occasionally fail to load (showing fallbacks)
- ⚠️ Newsletter signup success message needs styling improvement
- ⚠️ Mobile responsiveness needs minor adjustments

### Admin Dashboard

- ⚠️ Multiple navigation systems make the interface confusing
- ⚠️ Too many developer helpers visible to admin users
- ⚠️ Alert dialogs need to be replaced with a proper notification system
- ⚠️ CSS inconsistencies between admin pages
- ⚠️ Login page needs to be styled to match the rest of the site

## Currently Broken/Missing Features

### Events Management

- ❌ Events creation and editing form has inconsistent styling
- ❌ Multi-venue support (events that appear in both slideshows) not fully implemented
- ❌ Event gallery per venue needs work

### Flyer Management

- ❌ Granular controls for flyer upload and slideshow order incomplete
- ❌ Clicking a flyer should show event details and larger image

## Technical Debt

### Code Organization

- Duplicate CSS definitions across multiple files
- Outdated and unused files that need to be moved to a backup directory
- Inconsistent variable naming and function styles

### Backend Architecture

- Some endpoints still using legacy format instead of the unified API structure
- Caching implementation needs optimization

## Priority Action Items

1. Fix events management system to fully support:
   - Granular controls for event creation, editing, deletion
   - Flyer upload and slideshow order
   - Multi-venue support
   - Clean, informative event list presentation

2. Style login page to match the 404 page

3. Replace all alert dialogs with the notification system

4. Remove developer helpers visible to admin users

5. Clean up unnecessary files by moving them to a backup directory

## Deployment Notes

- Frontend deploys to dev.farewellcafe.com using Cloudflare Pages
- Admin backend deploys to admin.farewellcafe.com using Cloudflare Workers
- Both repositories should be committed to Git before deployment
- Use `npx wrangler deploy` for deployment
